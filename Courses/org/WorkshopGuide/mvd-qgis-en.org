*** Goals and data
**** Goals
     - Know how to display an image and set up rendering in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to display an image stack in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to display an image and set up rendering in QGIS,
     - Know how to display vector data in QGIS,
     - Know how to display an images stack in QGIS,
     - Tips and tricks.

**** Data
     The datasets can be found in the following directories:
     - ~Data/preprocessing~ (PlÃ©iades extract)
     - ~Data/classification/Extract16bits/~ (Sentinel-2 image series)
     - ~Data/classification/training/~ (vector data ESRI Shapefile)

*** Program

    - Display an image in Monteverdi
    - Display a stack of images in Monteverdi
    - Display an image in QGIS
    - Display vector data in QGIS

*** Introduction
    - Several software products which share common functions
    - But which sometimes differ in terms of philosophy (Monteverdi /image oriented/, QGIS
      /GIS platform/)
    - Several ways to do the same operation in these applications
*** Monteverdi
    - At the beginning simple tool to demonstrate OTB library potential
    - Move to an integrated application which allow to access OTB applications 
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on Qt
    - Rendering engine based on Ice (OpenGL+OTB)
    - Effects which use Graphic cards capability (shader) to allow to do on the
      fly rendering (local contrast,
      transparency, gradient...)

*** Monteverdi
    Main window contains:
      - Main menu (open image, close, preferences...)
      - Top toolbar (shortcuts)
      - Image displaying (main view)
      - Right side dock (color composition, quicklook...) 
      - Stack layer (image stack)
*** Quantum GIS 
    - GIS: organize and display spatial data
    - Main functions in a GIS :
      - Display and create maps
      - Data acquisition 
      - Data analysis 
      - Data representation
      - Storage
    - Lots of tutorials, technical courses available online...
*** Quantum GIS processing (since version 2.0)
    - Processing platform to access GRASS-GIS, SAGA-GIS, R and OTB!
    - Historically based on integration of Sextante project in QGIS (Victor Olaya)
    - Access to all OTB applications (some of them are customized with a
      simplified interface)
    - [[https://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing/index.html][See QGIS processing documentation]]
    - Since version >= 3.2 : better integration of OTB (6.6 +)

*** Principles
    - Discover data package and software
    - Monteverdi:
      - How to display and set up color rendering options
      - Know how to use the image stack
      - Explore available /Effects/
    - QGIS:
      - How to display and set up color rendering options
      - How to display vector data
      - Know how to use the image stack
    - Work in pairs for 15 minutes
    - Round table (30 to 45 minutes), every group does a restitution/shares a
      trick/asks a question...

**** Summary
     The goal is to discover software products and the data package that will be
     used during the course. You will be able to use both Monteverdi and QGIS to
     do all exercises of the course. 

**** Prerequisites

     - Install Monteverdi and QGIS
     - Download data
       
**** Goals

     Goals of this exercise

     - Know how to display an image and set up rendering in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to display an image stack in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to display an image and set up rendering in QGIS,
     - Know how to display vector data in QGIS,
     - Know how to display an image stack in QGIS,
     - Tips and tricks.

*** Steps                                                             :steps:

    For this exercise, we propose to work in pairs. At the end of the exercise
    every team will do a restitution of their experiments to show to other
    groups some tips they found and ask also some questions about functions
    available in both software products.

**** Display an image in Monteverdi

     Open the image ~phr_xs_osr_mipy.tif~ available in the ~Data/preprocessing~
     directory with Monteverdi.

     The list of all keyboard shortcuts is available in /Help/ menu.

     Change the displayed band and also change the rendering values. 

     Test effects like /Local contrast/, /Gradient/ and /Spectral angle/. What is their purpose?

     Change the zoom level by using the mouse wheel,
     you can edit also the image scale in the bottom in the status bar.

     Close Monteverdi.

**** Display an image stack in Monteverdi

     Open the 5 Sentinel-2 images in the ~Data/classification/images/~
     folder.

     Change the bands to display natural colors (red: Band 3, green: band 2, blue: band
     1). Use the /Apply all parameters to all layers/ button to have the same
     rendering options on the whole stack.

     Use /CTRL + mouse wheel/ to cycle between dates.

     Test effects /Local transparency/, /Chess board/ and
     /Swipe/. What is their purpose?

     Close Monteverdi.

**** Display an image in QGIS

     Open the first Sentinel-2 image in QGIS. Use the contextual menu of the layer to
     change color dynamics to have the same rendering as in Monteverdi. In the
     same contextual menu, add this style to be able to apply it to other images.

     Move in resolution.

     Open other Sentinel-2 images and apply the rendering style you've just created.

     What are the differences between Monteverdi and QGIS in terms of image
     visualization and rendering functions ?

**** Display vector data in QGIS

     Open ~training.shp~ in the ~Data/classification/references/training/~
     folder.

     Use the contextual menu to open the /Properties/ and /Style/ tabs. Use
     /Categorised/ using column /LC/. How many classes are there in the file? Change the
     color table to display different classes in different colors.

     Open the attribute table. How many polygons are contained in the class /pelouse/ (/lawn/)?

     Try to find how to select and display only polygons from this class.
