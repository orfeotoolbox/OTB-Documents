*** Goals and data
**** Goals
     - Know how to visualize an image and set up rendering in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to visualize an images stack in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to visualize an image and set up rendering in QGIS,
     - Know how to visualize vector data in QGIS,
     - Know how to visualize an images stack in QGIS,
     - Tips and tricks.

**** Data
     Dataset can be found in the following directories:
     - ~Data/preprocessing~ (Pléiades extract)
     - ~Data/classification/Extract16bits/~ (LandSat8 image series)
     - ~Data/classification/training/~ (vector data ESRI Shapefile)

*** Program

    - Visualize an image in Monteverdi
    - Visualize a stack of images in Monteverdi
    - Visualize an image in QGIS
    - Visualize vector data in QGIS

*** Introduction
    - Several software products which share common functions
    - But which sometimes differ in term of philosophy (Monteverdi /image oriented/, QGIS
      /GIS platform/)
    - Several ways to do the same operation in these applications
*** Monteverdi
    - At the beginning simple tool to demonstrate OTB library potential
    - Move to an integrate application which allow to access to OTB applications 
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on Qt
    - Rendering engine based on Ice (OpenGL+OTB)
    - Effects which use Graphic cards capability (shader) to allow to do on the
      fly rendering (local contrast,
      transparency, gradient...)

*** Monteverdi
    Main window contains:
      - Main menu (open image, close,preferences...)
      - Top toolbar (shortcut)
      - Image displaying (main view)
      - Right side dock (color composition, quicklook...) 
      - Stack layer (images stack)
*** Quantum GIS 
    - GIS: organize and display spatial data
    - Main functions in a GIS :
      - Display and create maps
      - Data acquisition des données
      - Data analysis 
      - Data representation
      - Storage
    - Lots of tutorials, technical courses available online...
*** Quantum GIS processing (since version 2.0)
    - Processing plateform to access to GRASS-GIS,SAGA-GIS, R and OTB!
    - Historically based on integrwation of Sextante project in QGIS(Victor Olaya)
    - Access to all OTB applications(some of them are customized with a
      simplified interface)
    - [[https://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing/index.html][Voir QGIS processing documentation]]

*** Principle
    - Discover data package and software
    - Monteverdi:
      - How to visualize and set up color rendering options
      - Know how to use image stack
      - Explore /Effects/ available
    - QGIS:
      - How to visualize and set up color rendering options
      - How to visualize vector data
      - Know how to use image stack
    - Work in pairs for 15 minutes
    - Round table (30 to 45 minutes), every group do a restitution/give a
      trick/ask a question...

**** Résumé
     Goal is to discover software products and the data package that will be
     used during the course. You will be able to use both Monteverdi or QGIS to
     do all exercises of the course. 

**** Pré-requis

     - Install Monteverdi and QGIS
     - Download data
       
**** Objectifs

     Goals of this exercise

     - Know how to visualize an image and set up rendering in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to visualize an images stack in Monteverdi,
     - Know how to visualize an image and set up rendering in QGIS,
     - Know how to visualize vector data in QGIS,
     - Know how to visualize an images stack in QGIS,
     - Tips and tricks.

*** Étapes                                                            :steps:

    For this exercise, we propose to work in pairs. At the end of the exercise
    every team will do a restitution of their experiments to show to other
    groups some tips they found and ask also some questions about functions
    available in both software products.

**** Visualize an image in Monteverdi

     Open the image ~phr_xs_osr_mipy.tif~ available in directory
     ~Data/preprocessing~ in Monteverdi.

     List of all keyboards shortcuts is available in menu /Help/.

     Change band display and also Modifiez les bandes visualisées and change
     rendering values 

     Test effects like /Local contrast/, /Gradient/ et /Spectral angle
     Spectral/. What are there purpose ?

     Change zoom level by using /CTRL + mopuse wheel/,
     you can edit also the image scale in the bottom in the status bar.

     Close Monteverdi.

**** Visualize images stack in Monteverdi

     Open the 9 LS8 images in folder
     ~Data/classification/Extract16bits/~.

     Change bands to display natural colors (red: Band 3, green: band 2, blue: band
     1). Use button /Apply all parameters to all layers/ to have the same
     rendering options on the all stack.

     Use mouse wheel to move between all dates.

     Test effects /Local transparency/, /Chess board/ et
     /Balayage/. What are there purpose ?

     Close Monteverdi.

**** Visualize an image in QGIS

     Open the first LS8 image in QGIS. Use the contextual menu of the layer to
     change color dynamics to have the same rendering as in Monteverdi. In the
     same contectual menu, add this style to be able to apply it to other images.

     Move in resolution.

     Open other LS8 images and apply the rendering style you've just created.

     What are the differences between Monteverdi and QGIS in term of image
     visualization and rendering functions ?

**** Visualize vector data in QGIS

     Open ~training.shp~ in folder
     ~Data/classification/training/~.

     Use the contextual menu to open /Properties/ and /Style/ tab. Use
     /Categorised/ using colum /LC/. How many classes in the file? Change the
     color to table to display different classes in different colors.

     Open attribute table. How many polygons are contain in the class /pelouse/ (/lawn/)?

     Try to find how to select and display only polygons from this class

   Live demo done by the instructor to show image manipulations and functions.
