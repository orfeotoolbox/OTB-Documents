*** Introduction SAR
    - Radar: measuring objects properties from distance with dedicated instruments
    - SAR: Synthetic Aperture Radar
    - Active sensor
    - Day and Night imaging capability
    - Atmosphere mainly transparent to SAR
    - Complementary information to optical systems
*** Principles
    - Use the flight path of the platform to simulate an extremely large antenna or aperture electronically
    - Properties from distance
    - Repeat echoes in the second dimension (azimuth)
    - Complex signal (amplitude and phase)
*** Radiometric calibration
    - Radar reflectivity (backscattered signal) of targets as a function of their position
    - backscattered coefficient can be a positive number if there is a focusing
      of  backscattered energy towards the radar
    - backscattered coefficient can be a negative number if there is a focusing
      of  backscattered energy way from the radar
    - Rugosity, humidity...
    - Calibration -> DN to backscattering coefficient
    - Examples:
      - Very high backscatter (above -5 dB) -> man made surfaces
      - High backscatter (-10 dB to 0 dB) -> rough surface, dense vegetation
      - Moderate backscatter (-20 to -10 dB) -> medium level vegetation, crops
      - Low backscatter (below -20 dB) -> smooth surface (water)
*** Geometric corrections
    - Spatialize images
    - Range (depend on the PRF) and Azimuth Resolutions (depends on the size of
      the antenna for a Radar System
    - Resolutions
      - $azimuthResolution = \frac{H*\lambda}{L*\cos(\theta)}$
      - $rangeResolution = \frac{c*prf}{2*\sin(\theta)}$
    - geometrical distortions (foreshortening and layover)
*** Speckle
    - Granular 'noise' that inherently exists in and degrades the image quality
    - Strong!
    - Speckle noise in SAR is a multiplicative noise, i.e. it is in direct proportion to the local grey level in any area
    - Several methods to try to reduce this noise
    - Try to reduce speckle effects without loosing to much details
    - Speckle filtering allows to improve image quality and facilitate interpretations
*** To go further

**** Summary
     
     The following exercise is an introduction to processing and analysis of SAR
     images using the ORFEO ToolBox.

     There are also a lot of other open source tools to process SAR images that
     can be used in combination with OTB (see PolSARPro, Sentinel-1 toolbox...) 

**** Prerequisites

     - Installed Monteverdi and Orfeo ToolBox software
     - Downloaded data
     - Understand Orfeo Toolbox applications (see relevant exercise)
       
**** Goal

     - SAR image manipulation
     - Radiometric calibration
     - Geometric corrections
     - Speckle filtering
     - Basic SAR polarimetry

*** Steps                                                             :steps:

    Data located in ~Data/sar~ folder.

**** Introduction to SAR images

In this exercise we will use an extract from a Sentinel-1 SLC Strip Map (80 km
Swath, 5 x 5 m spatial resolution): ~s1_hh.tif~ et ~s1_hv.tif~. The image is
located in Germany near the Constance lake (47.456276, 9.638616).

1. Open the image in Monteverdi. How many bands in both images? To what
   corresponds these bands in the complex product?
2. Compute image intensity of complex products ~s1_hh.tif~ et
   ~s1_hv.tif~. Compute also image intensity in decibel.

**** Radiometric calibration
     
     Pixel values in SAR images like S1 are without unit (radar reflectivity or
     radar brightness).

     Image metadata allows to transform DN to physical values (in case of SAR
     backscattering coefficient) which allows to compare images from different
     sensors and modes and perform analysis. 

     SAR calibration consists in computing one of the following physical values:
     - Beta Nought: \beta radar brightness coefficient. The reflectivity per
       unit area in slant range which is dimensionless.
     - sigma zero: radar backscatter ( portion of the outgoing radar signal
       that the target redirects directly back towards the antenna)
     - gamma zero: backscatter normalized with the incidence angle

     For Sentinel-1, Look Up Tables available in image metadata allows to
     convert from digital numbers to those values. ORFEO ToolBox will retrieve
     these values automatically and compute the backscattering coeficient.

     1. Find the application which allows to perform this operation with OTB?
     2. Compute gamma nought for HH and HV images. 
     3. Convert in decibel (Db).

**** Geometry corrections

     We will use here the output of the radiometric calibration exercise (gamma
     nought) as input.
     
     Use the *Orthorectification* application to perform geometric corrections
     using S1 metadata on SLC product:
        1. Without Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
        2. With a DEM and a geoid (use folder ~SRTM~)
        3. Compare the 2 images in Monteverdi.

**** Speckle filtering

     SAR images are affected by speckle noise  that inherently exists in and
     degrades the image quality. It is caused by coherent processing of
     backscattered signals from multiple distributed targets. It is locally
     strong and it increases the mean grey level of a local area.

     Several different methods are used to eliminate speckle noise, based upon
     different mathematical models of the phenomenon. In the following part we
     will use the /Frost/ filter. This algorithm has 2 parameters:

     - /Radius/: window radius
     - /deramp/: control exponential function use to moderate effect of the
       distance between the central pixel and its neighborhood.

     You can find more details about the Frost filter [[http://earth.eo.esa.int/download/eoedu/Earthnet-website-material/to-access-from-Earthnet/2011_ESA-CONAE-SAR-Capacity-Building-Argentina/Speckle.pdf][here]].

     1. What are despeckle methods available in OTB?
     2. Use the /Frost/ filter with different radius (3,5 and 10) and comment
        effects on the output image.
     3. Compare the histogram of the filtered image with the intensity?
     4. Use the /Frost/ filter with radius=5 and different /deramp/ values
        (00.5,0.2 et 0.8). Comment effects of the deramp parameter.

**** Polarimetry

     We will try to introduce basic notions of polarimetry to show that HH and
     HV polarizations allows to access to different types of information.

     1. Compute the difference between HH and HV (use intensity image as input).
     2. Create a color combination of bands HH, HV and HH-HV. We can take here
        2*HV as HV backscattered values are generally smaller.
     3. Convert the color composition in Decibel (Db)
     4. Display the image in Monteverdi and comment differences between HH and
        HV (layover areas, vegetation, soil, water...)
     5. Using the image which combines HH, HV and HH-HV in Decibel try to find
        in the extract:
        - Coordinates of 2 parallel power lines
        - Harder to find, locate in the image an area which looks like a corner
          reflector (reflects waves back directly towards the source)
        - What can you see in the lake at pixel coordinates (930,1170)?

**** Feature extraction

     To go further, we can explore available feature extractions methods for SAR
     available in OTB.

     See for instance Touzi filter in *EdgeExtraction* application.

** Introduction to SAR image processing                           :solutions:
**** Introduction to SAR image
1. The 2 extracts correspond to polarimetric combinations HH ( for horizontal
   transmit and horizontal receive) and HV for horizontal transmit and vertical receive
2. The 2 bands correspond to the real and the imaginary part of the complex signal.
3. We can use the *BandMath* app to compute the image intensity:

   For HH:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_BandMath \
   -il s1_hh.tif \
   -out intensity_hh.tif int32 \
   -exp "im1b1*im1b1+im1b2*im1b2"
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   For HV:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_BandMath \
    -il s1_hv.tif \
    -out intensity_hv.tif int32 \
    -exp "im1b1*im1b1+im1b2*im1b2"
   #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Radiometric calibration
     1. *SARCalibration*
     2. In the case of Sentinel-1, calibration coefficients are directly read in
        the product metadata
        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ otbcli_SARCalibration \
        -in "s1_hh.tif?&geom=s1_hh_calibration.geom" \
        -out s1_hh_gamma0.tif \
        -lut gamma
        #+END_EXAMPLE

        For HV:

        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ otbcli_SARCalibration \ 
        -in "s1_hv.tif?&geom=s1_hv_calibration.geom" \
        -out s1_hv_gamma0.tif \
        -lut gamma
        #+END_EXAMPLE
        
     3. Warning: pixel <= 0 in the log expression!

        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ otbcli_BandMath \
        -in s1_hh_gamma0.tif \
        -out s1_hh_gamma0_db.tif \
        -exp "im1b1>0?10*log10(im1b1):0"
        #+END_EXAMPLE

        For HV:

        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ otbcli_BandMath \
        -in s1_hv_gamma0.tif \
        -out s1_hv_gamma0_db.tif \
        -exp "im1b1>0?10*log10(im1b1):0"
        #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Geometric corrections
    1. Orthorectification without DEM:
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       $ otbcli_OrthoRectification \
       -io.in s1_hh_gamma0.tif \
       -io.out s1_hh_gamma0_ortho.tif uint16
       #+END_EXAMPLE
    2. With a DEM and a geoid:
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       $ otbcli_OrthoRectification \
       -io.in s1_hh_gamma0.tif \
       -io.out s1_hh_gamma0_ortho.tif uint16 \ 
       -elev.dem SRTM/ \
       -elev.geoid Geoid/egm96.grd
       #+END_EXAMPLE
    3. Default projection is UTM. 32 North.
**** Speckle filtering

     1. Available methods are: lee, frost, kuan et gamma map. Speckle filtering
        allows to increase image quality and facilitate image analysis and
        objects identification compare to the input signal.

     2. Using the *Despeckle* application and the /Frost/ filter:

        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ otbcli_Despeckle \
        -in intensity_hh.tif \ 
        -out intensity_hh_speckle.tif \ 
        -filter frost \
        -filter.frost.rad 3
        #+END_EXAMPLE

        The effect of increasing the radius is to smooth the image. It improves
        image quality in rather smooth areas but degrade details on more
        contrasted areas and  on small structures.  

     3. The histogram of the filtered image tend to become /Gaussian/ and differ
        from the Gamma distribution of the original image (right hand tail).
     4. Increasing /deramp/ parameter will lead to take more into account pixels
        far from the center and then increase the smoothing effects.
        
**** Polarimetry
     1. HH-HV:
        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ otbcli_BandMath \
      -il intensity_hh_speckle.tif intensity_hv_speckle.tif \
      -out hh-hv_speckle.tif \
      -exp "im1b1-2*im2b1"
        #+END_EXAMPLE
     2. Then, image concatenation:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ otbcli_ConcatenateImages \ 
      -il intensity_hh_speckle.tif \
      intensity_hv_speckle.tif hh-hv_speckle.tif \ 
      -out intensity_compo.tif 
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     1. Then convert in Decibel:

        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ otbcli_BandMath \
        -in intensity_compo.tif \
        -out intensity_compo_db.tif \
        -exp "im1b1>0?10*log10(im1b1):0"
        #+END_EXAMPLE
     2. Comments:
        - layover is a geometric effects similar signal between HH and HV
        - vegetation area (forest)
        - HV is less sensible to rugosity
        - Water areas: low backscatter
     3. Analysis of color composition:
        - Power lines around index (230,3700)
        - Reflector near index (3620,2925)
        - Anchor mast for boats
