*** Steps										    :steps:

     The data are in ~Data/internals/~ folder.

**** Encoding images

     With Orfeo ToolBox, the user chooses the image encoding type depending on
     the image. In general we'll use:
     - 8 bits unsigned encoding (with domain [0,255]) for outputs used on screen
       or paper.
     - 16 bits unsigned encoding to represent most satellite images
     - 32 bits unsigned encoding to represent intermediate processing steps,
      computation results with real numbers (e.g. NDVI, radiometric
      calibration...)

    In Orfeo ToolBox applications, the user can choose the image encoding (drop
      down menu in the GUI interface, or parameter in the command line).
      |--------+----------------------------------------+------------------|
      | *type* | *domain*                               | *number of bits* |
      |--------+----------------------------------------+------------------|
      | uint8  | [0,255]                                | 8 bits           |
      | int16  | [−32 767, +32 767 ]                    | 16 bits          |
      | uint16 | [0, 65 535]                            | 16 bits          |
      | int32  | [−2 147 483 647, +2 147 483 647]       | 32 bits          |
      | uint32 | [0, 4 294 967 294]                     | 32 bits          |
      | float  | [ -3.402823 × 10^38,3.402823 × 10^38 ] | 32 bits          |
      | double | [ -10^308, 10^308 ]                    | 64 bits          |
      |--------+----------------------------------------+------------------|

     Use *gdalinfo* to know the pixel encoding of ~image1.tif~ (you can also
     access it from QGIS). Analyse pixel values of the image in Monteverdi. What
     can you conclude?

     Use the *Convert* application to convert ~image1.tif~ to a 16 bits integer
     encoding. Compare both image file sizes. Use the *CompareImages*
     application to compare the content of both images. What can you conclude?
     Can you reduce the file size further? (See the extended filenames
     paragraph).

     Use the *RadiometricIndices* application to compute an NDVI (Normalized
     Difference Vegetation Index) from the 16 bits image.
     Keep the output encoding to 16 bits. Visualize the result. What do you
     notice? Which encoding should be used to properly store this image?

**** .geom files

     Look into the ~image1.geom~ file with a text editor. What seems to be its
     purpose? Which processing operations require this type of information?

**** Extended filenames

     Extended filenames are used to influence the image reading and writing
     process in Orfeo ToolBox. They are not application specific, but can be
     used with any Orfeo ToolBox based tool.

     The full list of options is listed in the Software Guide. We will
     illustrate here a few of them.

***** Read options

      Compare the following command outputs:

      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ otbcli_ReadImageInfo -in "image1.tif"
      $ otbcli_ReadImageInfo -in "image1.tif?&skipgeom=true"
      #+END_EXAMPLE

      What is the effect of the /skipgeom/ parameter?
      Note the similar /skipcarto/ which allows to ignore the coarse
      cartographic projection in the case of /Ortho Ready/ type products
      (projected onto an average altitude by default).

      Compare the following command outputs:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ otbcli_ReadImageInfo -in "image2.tif"
      $ otbcli_ReadImageInfo -in "image2.tif?&geom=image1.geom"
      #+END_EXAMPLE

      What is the effect of the /geom/ parameter? What can be its purpose?

***** Write options

      Among available write options from extended filenames, the /gdal:co/
      option allows to pass file creation options directly to GDAL.
      With this option, and with the Tif file format options available in GDAL,
      re-encode ~image1.tif~ to signed 12 bits with LZW compression.

      Compare file sizes and image contents with the *CompareImages*
      application.

      Another useful extended filename option is /box/. Use the /box/ option
      to write only to a 100x100 pixels square in the center of the image.

**** Streaming management

     By default, Orfeo ToolBox chooses the tiling method most suitable to the
     input image, and the block size which maximizes memory usage. Memory usage
     is specified to the application, or with the =OTB_MAX_RAM_HINT=
     environment variable.
     However, it is possible to modify this behavior with writer extended filenames.

     1. Use the *LocalStatisticsExtraction* application to process the first band
        of ~image1.tif~ with a radius of 9.

     2. Execute the above operation a second time, but this time completely
        disable streaming with the /streaming:type/ extended filename option.
        What do you notice?

     3. Execute the above operation a third time, but this time ask for a split
        of 1000 strips. Use the /streaming:type/, /streaming:sizemode/ and
        /streaming:sizevalue/. What do you notice?

     To observe these effects, it is recommended to open a system monitor
     tool and look at CPU load and I/O throughput.

**** Multi-threading

     By default, every filter in Orfeo ToolBox uses all available processing
     cores.
     This behavior can be altered with the
     =ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS= environment variable.

     Follow the previous example with the *LocalStatisticsExtraction*
     application and disable streaming. Use the above environment variable to
     decrease, and then increase the number of threads. What do you notice?

     You can use the /time/ command to measure execution time.

*** Encoding images

    *gdalinfo* with /image1.tif/ yields:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ $ gdalinfo image1.tif
    Driver: GTiff/GeoTIFF
    Files: image1.tif
    Size is 2000, 2000
    Coordinate System is `'
    Origin = (5400.000000000000000,4300.000000000000000)
    Pixel Size = (1.000000000000000,1.000000000000000)
    Image Structure Metadata:
    INTERLEAVE=PIXEL
    Corner Coordinates:
    Upper Left  (    5400.000,    4300.000)
    Lower Left  (    5400.000,    6300.000)
    Upper Right (    7400.000,    4300.000)
    Lower Right (    7400.000,    6300.000)
    Center      (    6400.000,    5300.000)
    Band 1 Block=2000x1 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Gray
    Band 2 Block=2000x1 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Undefined
    Band 3 Block=2000x1 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Undefined
    Band 4 Block=2000x1 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Undefined
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Pixels are therefore encoded with 32 bits floating point numbers.
    By looking at the pixel values in *monteverdi*, you can see that the
    values are integers and between 100 and 1600 approximately. The 32 bit
    encoding is therefore needlessly expensive.

    The *Convert* application allows to convert the encoded pixel type:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_Convert -in image1.tif -out image1_uint16.tif uint16
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    We can now compare image sizes, and see that the generated image only uses
    half the space of the original image:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ du -h image1.tif
    62M	image1.tif

    $ du -h image1_uint16.tif
    31M	image1_uint16.tif
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Using the *CompareImages* application also show that the image content is
    identical.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_CompareImages -ref.in image1.tif -meas.in image1_uint16.tif

    psnr: 0
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    To compute the NDVI, we use the following commands:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_RadiometricIndices -in image1.tif
                                -out image1_ndvi.tif uint16
                                -channels.red 1
                                -channels.green 2
                                -channels.blue 3 -channels.nir 4
                                -list Vegetation:NDVI
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Looking at the generated image in *monteverdi*, we see that the image is 0
    everywhere. The output encoding is therefore not appropriate. A floating point
    type should be used (the default for example).

*** .geom files

    The ~geom~ file contains information necessary for geometric and radiometric
    image corrections.

*** Extended filenames

**** Read option

     The /skipgeom/ read parameter allows to ignore the associated ~geom~ file.
     The ground pixel size is false and the acquisition date and sensor
     information has disappeared.

     The ~geom~ extended filename parameter allows to attach a ~geom~ file to an
     existing image. Among other things, it is useful for radiometric and
     geometric processing. By default, Orfeo ToolBox (via OSSIM) looks for a
     ~geom~ file with the same name as the image.

**** Write options

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ otbcli_Convert -in image1.tif
       -out "image1_comp.tif?&gdal:co:NBITS=12&gdal:co:COMPRESS=LZW"  uint16
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     The size of the image is:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ du -h image1_comp.tif
     23M	image1_comp.tif
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     8 MB are saved compared to the unsigned 16 bits image. The *CompareImages*
     application shows that the content stays the same.

     The box parameter is used as such:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ otbcli_Convert -in image1.tif
                      -out "image1_comp.tif?&box=1000:1000:100:100"  uint16
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     After this command, the output image is an extract of the total output,
     beginning at the $(1000, 1000)$ index and of size 100x100. This option can
     be used to visualize a result before processing the full image.

*** Streaming management

    The *LocalStatiticsExtraction* application is used as follows:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_LocalStatisticExtraction -in image1.tif -out image1_ls.tif
                                      -radius 9
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    We notice that the computation is done in several steps, interleaved with disk
    I/O. By default, Orfeo ToolBox specifies the optimal tiling.

    To completely disable streaming, use the following extended filename
    options:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_LocalStatisticExtraction -in image1.tif *
             -out "image1_ls.tif?&streaming:type=none" -radius 9
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    When processing is done in a single pass, only one disk write follows.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ otbcli_LocalStatisticExtraction -in image1.tif
      -out "image1_ls.tif?&streaming:type=stripped \
      &streaming:sizemode=nbsplits&streaming:sizevalue=1000"
      -radius 9
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    This time, we see multiple computation and disk writing steps. Computation time
        can be almost twice as long, because over tiling is suboptimal.

*** Multithreading

    Here's how to set the number of threads to 1:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ export ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=1
    $ otbcli_LocalStatisticExtraction -in image1.tif
                                      -out "image1_ls.tif?&streaming:type=none"
                                      -radius 9
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    In that case, computation time is much more significant. It can also be seen
    that increasing the number too much does not improve performance above a
    certain point (typically the number of
    CPU cores).
